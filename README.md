# RaspberryPI_projects

In this repository I will provide a lot of examples to some simple and easy going java codes to be run on the RPI.

-ledblink --> Using PI4J library with Maven (Ledblink)

-pi4j_addtriger --> Using PI4J library + Maven + Spring boot Maven in the build section of the POM.xml
(compare between the pom.xml content of pi4j_addtriger and that of ledblink)
